# Ben-Eaters-8bit-CPU
Ben Eaters 8bit CPU built in Digital

The CPU is built with the Program [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).
The code for generating the Controlword ROM has been writen by myself. Altough I used Ben's videos for a little help.

To start just open the mainbuild.dig in the Program!

If you want to add new Instructions to the CPU just use the HEX Generator and load the HEX file into the ROM of the Controlword!
